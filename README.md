# Domain Portfolio Manager

I started rewriting this project within the past year. For now, I am removing the old code from this repository. It will be back up soon.

## Update 2

As of 12/19/2023 I have decided to no longer work on or persue releasing DPM, until such time I can give it a complete rewrite. The current codebase is just way too old.

## Update

As of 9/7/2023 I have begun working on this project once again. I will release an alpha version for testing soon, but it is important to note:
  * No new features have been worked on or added since 2015.
  * This will mostly be a way to get DPM out there to folks who may still wish to use it.
  * I may or may not work on new features. I will likely focus on just bug and security fixes.
  * The code is not what I would consider modern, but I have made updates here and there.
